# e17-themes

This is a collection of all the Enlightenment 1.17 themes packaged for Bodhi Linux 2.x.

# Contributing

This repository of themes is for historical and educational purposes only. The edj files will probably fail to compile using the recent versions of edje and may not function as intended on Moksha.

Developers and potential themers for the Moksha desktop are encouraged to attempt to fix any of these edj files. Contact us for more information or assistance.

Thanks in advance.
